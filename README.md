## ðŸ“š Abstract <a name="abs"></a>

 Please find an automatic algorithm (ALAEM) based on leaves midrib detection in vertical RGB images to describe leaves orientation at the canopy level. The ALAEM algorithm was validated against in situ annotations of leaves orientation, showing a satisfactory agreement in the proportion of leaves oriented perpendicular to rows direction across sowing patterns, genotypes and sites.

### Example use : 

```
    Simply launch ALAEM.ipynb and required packages mentioned inside.
    Tutorial images are included in repo.
```
